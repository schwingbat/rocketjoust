# Rocket Joust
## A Game by the SCC Tech Club

Rocket Joust (working title) is a competitive, fast paced arena platformer in the vein of Joust, with movement and combat mechanics heavily inspired by rocket jumping techniques from Quake 3 Arena. Ideally, rounds would be very short with lots of accidental deaths and absolute chaos with players simultaneously trying to kill each other and avoid the gunfire generated by other people avoiding them. Perfect for tournaments and parties.

This game goes hand in hand with the Raspberry Pi-based game console the club is building. Licensing for emulated games could be a challenge to acquire for school functions and fundraisers, so here's the first of (hopefully) many in-house games for our in-house console, fully MIT licensed and open source.

It's built using the [LÃ–VE framework](http://love2d.org) and written in Lua.
